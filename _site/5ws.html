            <p class="lead">After taking a break, I've decided to try something new and different for Sophia Music Studio. Reflecting on my years of teaching, I've found the students who grow the most and have the most fun are the ones who have a clear idea of what they're working toward. So instead of ongoing, weekly lessons, where there's so much pressure for magic to happen in those 30-minute classes, I'm starting a new format: 3-month projects where we work together to achieve a specific goal for you. </p><div class="row justify-content-center mt-2 mb-2 p-4">

            <h2 id="how-will-this-work">How will this work?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We’re not focusing on completing a piano method book for a certificate &amp; recital. We’re completing a goal that has meaning to you.</li>
  <li>We’re not doing a 30-minute lesson a week format, but rather a 3-month intensive package project for your goal, a weekly 45-minute online meeting and offline ongoing conversations, focused assignments and check-ins throughout the week.</li>
  <li>I’m not interested in teaching an individual who is not driven by their own interest, because I know I will put my 100% time and energy to make things happen to those who are eager and excited to learn to achieving their goals. It must be a 2-way communication in order for this project to work.</li>
  <li>I’m only taking 10 students at one time to provide quality time and energy to focus on each individual.</li>
  <li>You are not going to go through the same method as others, because I will give you an individualized curriculum designed to your specific project, from the level you are now, derived from different sources of books, my own notes/exercises/drills, summary of the big picture and foundation of what you need to accomplish your goal.</li>
  <li>We will start conducting our fresh project in an organized matter where everything (our notes, Q/A, my video tutorials, your video/recording assignments and performances, online sources like YouTube links/articles) will be digitally captured and documented on Google Classroom, where we can go back anytime to assess, discuss, print etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Each project will run for 3 months.</li>
  <li>A project can start anytime, there are no seasonal start/end dates.</li>

  <li>We’ll also meet for a 15-minute check-in</li>
  <li>And we’ll have some asynchronous communication as well</li>
  <li>The meeting’s times can occur regularly but can be adjusted as needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are not your grandmother’s piano lessons. This is a creative musical project that I will design and coach you on to meet your goal.</p>

<p>I teach popular music on the piano through playing by ear, strong core foundation of rhythm, melody &amp; harmony using the chord-based system.</p>

<p>I will also incorporate to teach voice for those who are interested in singing while playing the piano, to achieve the wholesome experience of both worlds.</p>

<p>I teach non traditional but practical piano to play popular music you love.</p>
